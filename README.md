# Andrew Etter's approach to modern technical writing

This assignment feels wrong. Andrew Etter's book does not follow with the rest of the material presented in the assignment; and following the guide lines of the assignment results in breaking the rules set out in Etter's process. If one begins by describing the steps in hosting the resume results in needing to jam Etter's process into the flow of instructions, violating Etter's second step. If one begins by describing Etter's process, one gets a process description not the set of instructions the assignment requires. 

cutting the relations to Etter's process takes a lot of unnecessary junk out of the product; resulting in higher quality writing. 

Why is Etter's book a part of this? Of the five steps in his generic process only two logically connect to the instruction set we need to provide. 

- The first step (learn everything about the subject) best connects to the step of finding and following this guide; which is an instruction completed before it is issued and therefore unnecessary to discuss. 
- The second step (write only what needs to be written, nothing more) is most applicable to the writing of the resume; which is a prerequisite to following this guide. Again, this is unnecessary to discuss in this document.
- The third step (make the content beautiful), applies in the selection of a jekyll template. (which is absent from the marking guide?) 
- The fourth step (treat the content as a draft) Is applicable in that you need to update your resume.
- The final step (make contribution simple) is something you don't really want to do because its your resume; only you should be updating your resume.

Including Etter's process in this document does not make logical sense, and I don't see how it improves the assignment.

## Purpose

With this document, I seek to explain to you Andrew Etter's technical writing process as described in his book, "Modern Technical Writing: An Introduction to Software Documentation." This will be done with descriptions and a simple demonstration of hosting a resume on a static GitHub Pages website.

## Prerequisites

Hosting a resume on a GitHub Pages website requires that you have a resume and a GitHub account. Before continuing please ensure you have both. If you need help with preparing a resume, a link has been provided under the 'More Resources' section.

## Instructions

Andrew Etter's process begins with learning as much as you can about the subject you are writing on. This means exploring the subject to its fullest with hands on experience and asking questions of others. 

In terms of hosting your resume on a static website, the first step in the process would be seeking out guides like this one and working through them.

The second step of Etter's process is to write down only what your audience needs to know and nothing more.



write down exactly what an audience needs to know and **_no more_**   		which raises the question of why I am talking about this book on modern technical writing while describing how to host a resume on a static site

make the content beautiful, discoverable, scannable, and searchable		add a template

consider everything a draft, and iterate relentlessly				update your resume

This last step is the most important one in this process:

- **_UPDATE YOUR RESUME_** 


$$
(\frac{N}{2})^2 + (\frac{N}{2})^2 < N^2
$$
make contribution simple.			this is your resume, others really should not touch it

## FAQ

#### Why is Markdown better than a word processor?

Markdown provides a quick and simple process for making documents that work with HTML. If one wants to write a simple document to host on a website, writing it in actual HTML is too painful to be a desirable method. While standard word processors (that don't natively support Markdown) do offer powerful features, these features are overkill for producing Markdown text. Further, the hassle of converting from whatever formats the processor supports to .md for every document, outweighs the effort of downloading a markdown editor.
